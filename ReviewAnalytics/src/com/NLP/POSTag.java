		//String input = "First to mention, before buying this Beast: Galaxy Note 2, i had read a lot of reviews here in Flipkart on this mobile, but Max of them were on the common features that almost everyone knows from like the: -5.5 screen -Quad-Core -2GB RAM -Super AMOLED capacitive Touchscreen -16GB Internal -64GB External Expandable -Camera: 8MP(Main), 1.9(Front) -NFC -OS: Android Jelly Bean -GPU: Mail-400MP -Stylus Pen Yes, i agree, these are the Excellent Features which other phones cannot compete easily, BUT, there are loads of other interesting stuffs that any TECH SAVY person will like a lot!!! After buying this Galaxy Note 2 last week, i had been trying to figure out the extra features that this beast offers in excess to the mentioned above ones. Some of them are as follows: -First of all, the most attractive feature that i really liked was the Motion Sensor Capabilities that this beast is offering. Let me note down some of them as tested by me: 1) To unlock the device with motion, tap and hold a point on the screen, and then tilt the device forwards. 2) When you pick up the device after it has been idle for some time or when the screen has turned off, it vibrates if you have missed calls or new messages. 3) While viewing a call, a message, or contact details on the phone screen, simply pick up and hold the device to your ear to make a call to that number. 4) Tap and hold an item on the screen, and then move the device to the left or right to move the item to another panel on the Home screen or the Applications screen in that direction. 5) When an image is zoomed in, tap and hold a point on the screen, and then move the device in any direction to browse the image. 6) While you are cheking mails or contacts in a page and you reach the middle or the last of the list, simply Double-tap the device to move to the top of a list of contacts or emails. 7) While the screen is locked, tap and hold the screen, and then rotate the device to landscape orientation to launch the camera. 8) Turn over the device(making it lie down with back-side up) to mute ringtone, pause media playback, or mute the FM radio. 9) Shake the device to search for Bluetooth devices. 10) Shake the device to update the list of emails or information from Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance etc. 11) Sweep your hand sideways across the screen from right to left to capture a screenshot. 12) Cover the screen with a palm to pause media playback. Move it away from the screen to resume. 13) Tap and hold two points on the screen, and then tilt the device back and forth to zoom in or out. 14) When the touch screen is turned off, move your hand across the Proximity/Light sensor to turn on the screen lightly and view the number of missed calls and new messages, the battery power level, and more. The above are the special features that this phone provides in respect to various motions. - Secondly, like the Galaxy S3, it has the Smart Stay, which enables the phone to keep the screen on as long as you are looking at it. When you close your eyes or move away from looking into the screen, the Phone screen will automatically turn off. - Thirdly, with the Quad-core processor and 2GB RAM, Gamers will really love this phone since some VERY HIGH RESOLUTION GAMES are just running with not a single point of lag in this phone. - Fourthly, You would luv to watch videos in this phone due to itz big screen and the very good quality videos running smoothly. - Fifthly, Music quality is really very good and descent. Radio works perfect. - Sixthly, SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) Level is relatively low(The lower the Better) for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 in comparision to other phones: Galaxy Note 2: 0.171 W/kg Galaxy Note: 0.39 W/kg Galaxy S3: 0.342 W/kg Galaxy S2: 0.338 W/kg iPhone 4S: 0.98 W/kg iPhone 5: 0.951 W/kg HTC One X: 0.909 W/kg Apart from the above mentioned features: - I have not tested with the camera yet since i already have a Digital Camera. But as read from reviews, the camera is quite good in its capabilities, with 1.9 front camera is just great. - Also not tested with the full capability of the Stylus Pen, since it has loads of functionalities that has to be checked in details :-) So simply after examining withlots of such exciting features, it simply stands out tall in the market.";
